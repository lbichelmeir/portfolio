    <div class="aboutme">
      <p class="aboutme_p"> hello! My name is Lauren and I‚Äôm a freshman/sophomore studying Computer Science at Northwestern. I‚Äôm currently on a gap year (spring/winter 2021) learning German while exploring my various interests in computer science. As I only became a CS major in Fall 2020 (I was a materials science major in my first-year), I still haven‚Äôt narrowed down my interests. I‚Äôm using my gap year to explore web development, human-computer interaction, UI/UX design, machine learning, data science, mobile development, etc (I know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lot‚Ä¶.) </p>

      <p class="aboutme_p"> I‚Äôm exploring these interests through personal projects, MOOCs, and my involvement with on-campus organizations. </p>

      <!-- <p class="aboutme_p"> ^ I was a sophomore in the fall but then decided to take a gap year for winter and spring quarter, so I don‚Äôt know what that makes me‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p> -->
